Your First Mobile App
The purpose of this lab is for you to successfully install the Expo CLI, start a new React Native project, and get your very first mobile app running on your device!!

Steps
Installing Expo CLI
Use the video walkthrough and reference materials to get Expo CLI installed on your machine and reporting a version
expo --version should respond with 2.xx.x or higher in your terminal
Initializing Your First App
Use expo init YourProjectName to initialize a new React Native project using expo
Use npm start in your new project directory to get your local web development server running
Use the Expo client app on your phone to successfully get your first app showing up!
Converting to TypeScript
Close down your bundler, stop your terminal, and exit from the Expo client app on your phone
Use the video walkthrough and reference material to get TypeScript support added into your project
Get your app running on your device again after adding TypeScript
Let's Explore!
Change the container background color to lightgreen
Change the text within the container to say #crushingit
Change the text color to red
Hint: Look at how the StyleSheet creates a new style object named "container" for the View component, use this to create your own object with styling properties for the text
Change the text background color to red and the text color to white
Using this as some additional help, change the text font family to something safe for your device
Change the text font size to 40
You should have something resembling this at this point.

Wrap your View component in another View component
Give it the following properties:
flex of 1
backgroundColor of red
padding of 20
You should have something resembling this at this point.

We've wrapped our light green view, with a red view. But notice it won't be "visible" until we add the padding. Try adding different values, and removing it entirely, to see what it does to our app. Change the padding back to 20 and let's finish this!

Using your knowledge of View and basic styling, try to recreate this on your app: another View component with a black background color!
Your final result should resemble this masterpiece!
Having Fun
Use https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis to add other native components, mess with their props, add styling, and have some fun. Learn some of the basics react-native offers you before we build on these components with a UI Kit in the next labs.
